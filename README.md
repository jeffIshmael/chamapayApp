## Introduction

Chamapay is a mobile application that digitizes circular savings groups (commonly known as "chamas" in East Africa). It leverages blockchain technology to provide a secure, transparent, and accessible platform for group savings and financial collaboration.

### What are Circular Savings?

Circular savings (or "chamas") are community-based savings groups where members contribute fixed amounts at regular intervals. Funds are then distributed rotationally to each participant, combining savings and peer lending.

## Problem Statement

Traditional circular savings groups face several limitations:

1. **Geographical Barriers** ‚Äì Limited to physical communities due to trust requirements (e.g., workplace or neighborhood groups).
2. **Lack of Variety** ‚Äì Few options for joining different types of savings groups.
3. **Manual Management** ‚Äì Requires extensive record-keeping (contributions, payouts, penalties) which is prone to errors.

## Solution

Chamapay solves these problems by offering a **digital circular savings platform** powered by the **Celo blockchain**. Key benefits include:

- **Smart Contract Automation** ‚Äì Contributions and payouts are enforced programmatically.
- **Transparency** ‚Äì All transactions are recorded on-chain.
- **Financial Inclusion** ‚Äì Low-cost mobile transactions with cKES (a Kenyan Shilling-pegged stablecoin).

## Workflow

1. **Sign Up**

   - Users register with email, username, and password.
   - A wallet address and recovery phrase are generated.

2. **Create or Join a Chama**

   - Users can create **public** or **private** chamas.
   - Public chamas require locking funds as collateral.

3. **Deposit Funds**

   - Contributions can be made via **M-Pesa** or crypto transfer.

4. **Automated Payouts**
   - Smart contracts handle payouts based on the schedule.

- Members must lock funds to cover potential defaults.
- If a user misses a payment, locked funds are used automatically.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Private Chamas**

- Designed for trusted groups (no collateral required).
- Admins approve members to join.
